Here we have a password generator which was given to me with the original html and css in tact. I've modified the javascript to allow the application to function as required.

## The Process
Once the user lands on the page and engages the "Generate Password" button, they will receive a series of prompts.
- First the user will be prompted to input a preferred password length ranging from 8 to 128 characters. If the user inputs an invalid number or character, they will be alerted to correct their input.
- After having selected a valid password length, the user will be prompted to determine whether or not they would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.
- The user should select "OK" if they wish to include the given character type and "Cancel" if not.
- After the user has successfully responded to all of the prompts, a random password will be displayed for the user to copy and use as they choose.
